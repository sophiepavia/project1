  After reading over the project description again I had some questions. So I'm putting them here to document them and provide a place for y'all to contribute 
  your own as well. 
   1) In the restrictions, are we allowed to use fork() or do we need to implement our own version?
   2) What does implementing execv() entail? 
   3) How often should we meet/what goals/deadlines should we set for ourselves? 
   4) For the assumptions, will we make our shell robust in the sense that we DONT need to test for the assumptions because they're assumed, or that we need to 
            make sure an error message prints out for every case in which the assumptions are infringed?

   3) This can definitely be revised later depending on how much work each part takes but I think we should at least meet twice 
   a week. It could also be benefical to text the person who is working on the same part as you for questions/advice. A good goal 
   to have is to get started far enough in advance as to be able to attend office hours for each part as needed. For example, we
   each have 6 parts so we should leave ourselves enough time to attend 6 office hours. Our professor does hold office hours 
   multiple times so this is just a base line estimate and I can defintely see myself attending more than that. 
   
   4) I am not sure what assumptions you are referring to but normally I do like to print out error messages when testing
   my code to make sure all of the edge cases are covered. I could have misread your statment though and be talking about
   something else.

  hello!
  3. I agree with sydney those sound like great goals and I agree texting your partner for the section would be very beneficial. 
  As for the other concerns I feel like I do not know enough yet to accurately answer them but I will come here if I arrive at any conclusions.
