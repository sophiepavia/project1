  After reading over the project description again I had some questions. So I'm putting them here to document them and provide a place for y'all to contribute 
  your own as well. 
   1) In the restrictions, are we allowed to use fork() or do we need to implement our own version?
   2) What does implementing execv() entail? 
   3) How often should we meet/what goals/deadlines should we set for ourselves? 
   4) For the assumptions, will we make our shell robust in the sense that we DONT need to test for the assumptions because they're assumed, or that we need to 
            make sure an error message prints out for every case in which the assumptions are infringed?
